    Please override me to include a favicon in your webpage. In order to do so, you
    can use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or any other alternative and save the
    resulting images under your `/static` folder. After that, just create a
    `layouts/partial/favicon.hmtl` file in your project and paste the html
    definitions generated before.
